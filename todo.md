# üìù CounterAPI - To-Do List

This file tracks planned features and improvements for the CounterAPI project.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Core API for CRUD and pinging projects.
- [x] PostgreSQL (Filess.io) database integration.
- [x] Deployment setup for Render.com with environment variable configuration (no code changes needed).
- [x] Comprehensive `README.md` and usage documentation.
- [x] Interactive frontend dashboard (`index.html`) for managing projects.
- [x] Environment detection and configuration for the frontend.
- [x] `/meta` endpoint for detailed DB info.

---

## üéØ Next Up (Short-Term)

- [ ] **API Key Authentication**: Secure the API endpoints so that only authorized users can add, edit, or delete projects. Pinging can remain public.
- [ ] **SVG Badges**: Create a new endpoint `/projects/{name}/badge` that generates a dynamic SVG badge (like shields.io) displaying the current count. This is great for embedding in GitHub READMEs.
- [ ] **Enhanced Dashboard Stats**: Add a chart to the dashboard to show visit history for a selected project (e.g., last 7 days).

---

## üöÄ Future Ideas (Long-Term)

- [ ] **User Accounts**: Introduce a simple user system to allow different people to manage their own sets of projects.
- [ ] **Data Export**: Add an endpoint to export all project data to a CSV or JSON file.
- [ ] **Backend Logging**: Implement more robust logging on the backend for easier debugging.
- [ ] **FastAPI Auto-Docs**: Customize and expose the built-in FastAPI documentation (`/docs` and `/redoc`) for a more formal API reference.
- [ ] **More Granular Pinging**: Allow pings to include metadata (e.g., version, source) to track usage more granularly.
