## üöÄ Deploy in Minutes (No Coding Required!)

### 1. Create a Free PostgreSQL Database

- [![Create Free DB on Filess.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/Create%20Free%20DB-Filess.io-blue?logo=postgresql)](https://filess.io/)
- Go to [Filess.io Free Cloud DB Plans](https://filess.io/) and sign up for a free account.
- Create a new PostgreSQL database (choose the latest version if possible).
- Copy your database credentials (host, port, db name, user, password).
- **Or see [this gist for more free cloud DB options](https://gist.github.com/bmaupin/0ce79806467804fdbbf8761970511b8c).**

### 2. Deploy to Render

- Click this button:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/Life-Experimentalist/CounterAPI)

- Render will detect `render.yaml` and prompt you for environment variables:
    - `DB_HOST` (e.g. `your-db-host.filess.io`)
    - `DB_PORT` (e.g. `5432` or as given by Filess.io)
    - `DB_NAME` (your database name)
    - `DB_USER` (your database user)
    - `DB_PASS` (your database password)
- Fill in these values from your Filess.io dashboard.
- Choose a service name and region (pick one close to your DB for best speed).
- Click **Create Web Service** and wait for deployment.

That's it! Your API is live and ready to use. No code changes or manual setup required.
